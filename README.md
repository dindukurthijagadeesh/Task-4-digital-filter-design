The objective of this project was to design, simulate, and verify a basic Digital Filter using Verilog HDL within the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite. Digital filters are essential components in digital signal processing (DSP) systems, used to remove unwanted components or features from a signal. This project focused on designing a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter – a commonly used digital filter type – and simulating its behavior with test data.A testbench was created to apply sample input data to the filter and observe the output. The testbench:

Defined sample values to simulate a signal.

Monitored outputs for each clock cycle.

Verified output correctness by comparing with manually calculated values or expected filter behavior.

The simulation was run using Vivado’s Behavioral Simulation tool. The waveform viewer was used to verify the timing of input and output signals, confirm correct filter operation, and debug any issues.
